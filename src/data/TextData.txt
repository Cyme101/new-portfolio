About Me

Bonjour-Hi, I'm Isabelle Vallerand.
            
I am a Web Developer based out of Quebec, Canada. I became
interested in IT world and over the past 10 years, I've worked as a
Support Analyst therefore problem-solving skills is in my DNA. My
career change in 2021 led me to learn how to code and I became
passionate about it.
        
I've enrolled in an intensive 9-weeks Full-Stack Web Development
Bootcamp @ Le Wagon Montreal which I graduated in March 2022. I have
a passion for the Front-End but I love what the backend offers in
terms of challenges.
      
I am currently enrolled in the web development program @ O'Sullivan
College in Quebec City and in search of an internship that will
starts in January 2024. But really I'm looking for a full-time job
where I can continuously learn and grow.
    
I am also a cat mom.
