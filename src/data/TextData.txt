About Me

Bonjour-Hi, I'm Isabelle Vallerand
Front-End Developer based out of Mtl, Canada
I am from Quebec city and moved to Montreal a few years ago. I come from a Fashion Design background but I became interested in IT quickly. Over the past 10 years, I've worked as a Support Analyst therefore problem-solving skills is in my DNA.

Last year I decided to learn to code as a career change and found out that coding is what I love to do. I've enrolled in an intensive 9-weeks Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp @ Le Wagon Montreal which I graduated in March 2022. The Front-End is where I like to challenge myself and create through code.

I am also a cat mom.
